# Rivage
*Under development*

Rivage is a minimalist e-learning application designed as a lightweight alternative to Moodle.

The project focuses on ease of use, a clear interface, and the ability to quickly upload educational content. It is primarily intended for teachers who want to share resources without the complexity of a traditional LMS.
